### Prerequisites

The current version of the NexusForever.Launcher requires the .NET 8.0 runtime, this can be found on the Microsoft [website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0).

### Download

Download the latest version of the client for the [GitHub release page.](https://github.com/NexusForever/NexusForever.Launcher/releases)

### Setup

Run NexusForever.Launcher.exe from any directory, make sure to run the application as Administrator!

The launcher on start up will attempt to automatically locate your WildStar installation and gather information on installed languages and architectures.\
You can confirm if this has been successful by going to the Game tab and seeing if the client location is displayed under the Client Information header.

If the Client Information is blank, you will need to manually select your client installation directory in the Game tab by clicking on the 'Browse Client...' button.

Browse to the location of your WildStar client (this is the root folder containing the 'Patch' and 'Client' folders) and click 'Select Folder'.

If done successfully, you will now see information on your WildStar client displayed in the Game tab.
